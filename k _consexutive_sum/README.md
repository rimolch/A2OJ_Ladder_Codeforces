Given an array of n positive integers and k.find the starting index of minimum k consecutive sum.
Example:
        7 3
        1 2 6 1 1 7 1
        here the minimum k consecutive sum will be 8 (6 1 1) and starting index 3
    Explanation:
         1 2 6 = 9 
         2 6 1 = 9
         6 1 1 = 8(minimum)
         1 1 7 = 9
         1 7 1 = 9
         
```
